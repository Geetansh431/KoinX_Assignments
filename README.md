# KoinX

This project is a server-side application built with Node.js and MongoDB that tracks and provides statistics for three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Matic, and Ethereum. The application fetches real-time data from the CoinGecko API and includes endpoints to retrieve and analyze this data.


## Features

- A scheduled job runs every 2 hours to fetch the latest price (in USD), market cap (in USD), and 24-hour change for Bitcoin, Matic, and Ethereum from the CoinGecko API.
- The fetched data is stored in a MongoDB database.
- Retrieves the most recent statistics for a specified cryptocurrency which includes details such as the latest price, market cap, and 24-hour change percentage.
- Computes the standard deviation of the price for the last 100 records stored in the database for a specified cryptocurrency.


## Tech Stack

**Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.

**Express.js**: Framework for creating RESTful APIs.

**MongoDB**: Database to store cryptocurrency data.

**Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB.

**Node-cron**: For scheduling background jobs.

**Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the CoinGecko API.
